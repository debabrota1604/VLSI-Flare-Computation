Root of all classes is Info.class.
Info uses object of Net.
Net uses object of Tree.
Tree uses object of Node.
Dimension is a general structure which is used to hold the dimension of nodes.


The whole input can be taken into memory by initializing the class objects. After that computations can be done.

How to read the data?
	The input file is sequential. So, the input should be read in a loop. 
	At the deepest nesting there is the Node object which is to be initialized first.
	Then the pointer to the Node object is to be used in the Tree object.
	Similarly the upper levels are to be initialized.
	As the Info class stores the basic info about the number of nets and number of trees
	for each net, we can end this parsing in a systemetic way.
	
	So, at the start, we need to read the initial data for info class. But we cannot initialize
	the Net objects at this very beginning. So, we need to define the unparameterized default 
	constructors for each class. After that the object is created, we need to use setter method at
	each class to insert the actual data.
